# RedgarNotepad
A simple but very easy to use and useful notepad app. You can save, cut, copy, and paste. There are future updates coming including a toggable switch to make the app
overlay over other apps like a post it note. Sorry about the messy root file programming with putting images in the root directory. This is how it should look if you are planning to
execute in your ide. (I use Pycharm)
